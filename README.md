Abstract
The Cyclist Posture Analysis System is aimed to
provide a solution which is able to measure riderâ€™s frontal area
(Ap) directly from digital photographs captured by affordable
smartphones. Effective recognition and segmentation will be
the key to identify and pull out the area of pixels belonging
to the rider in a digital photograph. An SVM model is placed
following the U-Net model to do the inference of the frontal
area in actual.
